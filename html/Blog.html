          <p>
            The most astounding thing to happen to humankind is scientific innovation or technology. Technology is no longer a luxury in today's environment; it is now a need. Since humans have become reliant on technical breakthroughs, life without it is all but impossible. We require a machine for every human task, and then comes technology. It has improved the convenience and ease of living for everyone, as well as the accessibility of jobs, education, and other services like transportation. In the quick-paced, constantly-evolving world of today, technological breakthroughs occasionally shift. But in the modern world, technology is essential to improving a nation's economy and the quality of life for its citizens.

          <p>
            Transport has become considerably simpler thanks to technology. Today, we may travel hundreds of kilometers in the comfort of our climate-controlled cars, planes, and trains in a single day. We can go over hills and mountains with trains, and we can travel across the seven seas in a matter of days with airplanes. Travel is currently regarded as a luxury. The creation of laptops and tablets has greatly simplified business. In only a few clicks, one may purchase and sell products, publish job listings, hire candidates from all over the world, and engage with business partners that are located far away. Attending conferences is now simpler thanks to face-to-face communication tools like Skype. Hard disks and USBs made data storage simpler than ever before.

          <p>
            Although technology provides benefits, it also negatively impacts a number of aspects of life. Technology addiction is creating new psychological issues. Since the invention of these devices that emit dangerous radiation, anxiety disorders, vision problems, and heart problems have increased. Long periods of time in front of computers have been linked to conditions such as migraines, arthritis, hazy vision, spine dislocations, and more. Both office workers and students are greatly distracted by their mobile devices and computers. Social networking is causing communication gaps due to heavy usage. Since technology took over, generational disparities, divorces, and rifts have increased.

            While we were working on the same project for our course, I had the chance to learn how to run an e-commerce website and do research on the impact of selling bonsai plants through an online platform. A plant may now charge less for the goods it produces because to technology, which also helps it become more productive, or efficient. Both buyers and sellers benefit from the crucial time savings. Products could be ordered with customer customization based on their requirements. Although there are many other benefits of technology that are important for selling and buying plants on e-commerce websites, I will focus on these as they are the most important.

      <sequuntur>
        Trees and plants that have been trained to look even more lovely than those that would naturally grow in the wild are known as bonsai. As a result, growing bonsai is both a traditional Japanese art and a very creative hobby. It also serves as a fantastic example of the delicate respect that Japanese people have for all living things and a manifestation of their appreciation of the beautiful. It involves a lot more work and calls for a greater mental and physical commitment than producing flowers in pots. Although the term "bonsai" was first used in a poem in the middle of the fourteenth century, earlier examples of bonsai culture may be found in picture scrolls from as early as 1309. Around three centuries later, during the Edo era, it was more extensively embraced (1603â€“1867).
